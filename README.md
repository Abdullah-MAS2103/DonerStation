This is a simple HTML page to display a restaurant coupon image hosted on Google Drive.

## How to Use

1. Upload this folder to your GitHub repository (suggested name: `restaurant-coupons`).
2. Enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings (choose the root folder from the `main` or `master` branch).
3. Access your page at:

```
https://Abdullah-MAS2103.github.io/restaurant-coupons/coupon1.html
```

You can generate a QR code for that link and print or share it!
